# Overview Of Election
The purpose of this challenge was to analyze the data that was provided based on the out come of the election. Seth reqested 
that we assisted the board of election in Colorado with the election audit. With the help of Python I was asble to write algorithims to help me with my findings. With my findings I was able to give Seth the election audit he requested.

# Election-Audit Summary
Base on my findings. I noticed it was not an eas task to gather all the information I needed to perform the analysis. Using what I've learned in order to perform the analysis was a bit challenging. However it was really interesting to see how I was able to work it out. The script I used to complete this task may have confused the out come. To many steps were used in order to complete it. For the next election I would use a more simpler script that would allow me to get the out come faster.
